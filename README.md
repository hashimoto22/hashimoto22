## Senior AI fullstack engineer & Software Architect

### About Me

- I’m a Senior AI fullstack Engineer and software architect with over 7 years of coding experience across a broad stack. I design scalable systems, APIs, and user-centric frontends with a strong emphasis on reliability, maintainability, and performance.
- Core strength: building robust backends with .NET (ASP.NET Core, Web API, Razor Pages, Blazor), Java (Spring Boot), Node.js/NestJS, Next.js, and MERN/MEAN stacks. I thrive on solving complex problems with clean architecture, design patterns, and pragmatic engineering.
- I enjoy turning ideas into production-ready software, leading feature teams, and mentoring junior engineers. I’m passionate about software craftsmanship, automated testing, and DevOps practices that improve deployment velocity and system resilience.
- Tools & technologies span cloud-native architectures, microservices, event-driven design, REST/GraphQL APIs, CI/CD pipelines, containers, and telemetry/observability.

## Core Competencies

- **AI Agent & ML-Driven Systems**
  - Hands-on experience designing and implementing AI agents and ML-driven backend services that augment product workflows and automate complex decision-making.
  - Built conversational agents and autonomous task agents integrating LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, local/on-prem models), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with vector stores, and prompt engineering for robust, context-aware behavior.
  - Architected orchestration layers for agent pipelines: multi-step planning, tool use (APIs, databases, search), state management, and safety/guardrails (rate limits, content filtering, input validation).
  - Integrated observability and evaluation: telemetry for prompts and responses, automated evaluation metrics (accuracy, relevance, hallucination rate), and A/B testing for agent behavior.

- **Backend & API Design**
  - .NET Framework and .NET Core / ASP.NET Core Web API
  - Razor Pages, Blazor (Server & WebAssembly)
  - Java Spring Boot (REST, microservices)
  - Node.js / NestJS (GraphQL & REST)
  - Next.js (Server Components, API Routes)
  - MERN/MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Angular/Vue, Node.js)

- **Architecture & Patterns**
  - Clean Architecture, SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  - Microservices, Monolith-to-Microservices strategies
  - Event-driven design, messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
  - API design: REST, GraphQL, OpenAPI/Swagger

- **Databases & Persistence**
  - SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
  - ORM: Entity Framework Core, Dapper, Hibernate (Java)
  - Caching, data modeling, and performance optimization

- **Frontend (Full-Stack Context)**
  - Blazor (Server & WASM), Next.js, React-based frontends
  - Razor Pages, SPA patterns, responsive UI

- **DevOps & Observability**
  - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins)
  - Docker/Kubernetes, cloud-native deployments
  - Logging, metrics, tracing (Serilog, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana)

- **Testing & Quality**
  - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
  - Static code analysis, code quality gates

- **Security & Compliance**
  - OAuth2 / OpenID Connect, JWT
  - Secure API design, input validation, threat modeling

## Selected Experience Highlights

- Led end-to-end architecture and delivery of multiple large-scale backend systems using ASP.NET Core Web API, with clean architecture and domain-driven design.
- Built and scaled microservices with event-driven communication and robust data consistency strategies.
- Migrated legacy services to modern .NET Core and integrated modern frontend frameworks (Next.js, Blazor) to deliver cohesive UX.
- Designed and implemented secure RESTful endpoints, GraphQL schemas, and efficient data access layers.
- Implemented comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, contract testing) and automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Mentored engineers across frontend and backend teams, establishing best practices and coding standards.
